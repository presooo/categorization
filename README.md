# Description

This is purely an ideation of mine rather than a working application. 
Structure - CQRS + RESTful APIs.

I have included my answers to the Questions in the QUESTIONS.md

* `How long did you spend on the coding test?` - About 2 hours
* `Did you manage to cover everything that you wanted to?` - Not really
* `What would you add to your solution if you had more time?` - Create the category repositories and commands, implement an interface that can be used by the users to action the categorisation
* `Would you choose different technologies if this were to become a reliable enterprise system? Why? Or, why not?`  - Mmm, I might use Go in the future due to the better performance and simplicity but I am still learning it.
